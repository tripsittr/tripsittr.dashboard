                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-white leading-relaxed">
                    Fort Vine, comprised of husband-and-wife duo Trevor Tunison and Nyna Nelson, is known for their vibrant indie-folk-pop sound. Named after a secret Manhattan tree fort, they’ve toured the U.S. in their DIY-converted Sprinter van, <em>Gypsee Bungalow</em>, since 2018. Recently, their beloved van broke down, and they purchased a new one. They have been building it and plan to go on tour in 2025 in their new van, <em>Bodhi Bungalow</em>. With four records, including <em>Primordial Mirror of Cosmic Reflection</em>, and singles like <em>Key To Love</em> featured in Apple’s campaigns, Fort Vine blends art-pop and psychedelic grooves with heartfelt lyrics.
